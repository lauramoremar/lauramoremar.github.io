## Bio
Hello! I'm an **Assistant Professor** in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Alicante (UA), in Spain.


**My research** focuses on computational fluid and solid mechanics, with a particular interest in developing numerical methods to simulate complex and highly dynamic phenomena. My work spans from addressing finite element (FE) problems involving highly elastic viscoelastic flows, fluid–structure interaction, to contributing to recent advances in the Material Point Method (MPM). The later is a particle-based technique especially effective for simulating events such as granular flows, landslides, and avalanches, and even used to create the stunning snow effects in Disney’s [Frozen animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kyDKu8K-k).



Although my current research primarily focuses on engineering applications, **I am not an engineer by training**.

**I began my academic journey studying Mathematics** at the University of Alicante. Motivated by a strong interest in applied mathematics, I pursued a Master's degree specializing in <ins>mathematical modeling for the numerical simulation of physical phenomena</ins>. During my PhD at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), my research centered on developing mathematical models to simulate highly elastic <ins>viscoelastic flows</ins>. After completing my doctorate, I joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Padua (Italy) as a postdoctoral researcher, where I began working with the <ins>Material Point Method (MPM)</ins> to simulate the behavior of structures under extreme natural events. I later continued this line of research at [the Institut für Statik und Dynamik](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/isd) at the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS) in Germany.

As an educator, I aim to inspire curiosity and foster critical thinking among my students. **I teach calculus courses tailored to various engineering disciplines**, including aerospace, telecommunications, architecture, and robotics. My approach emphasizes connecting theoretical concepts with practical applications, helping students see mathematics as a powerful tool for solving real-world challenges.

In addition to my academic and teaching work, I am an active member of the [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos) community, where I contribute as a [developer](https://github.com/lauramoremar). Kratos is an open-source simulation software, written in C++ and Python, that focuses on advanced computational mechanics, and I am proud to be involved in its ongoing development.

<!-- Finally I would also like to mention a **personal project** to which I dedicate my free time. I would like to point out that the gender gap in science, and in particular in engineering, is a fact today, as indicated by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/un-chronicle/lack-gender-equality-science-everyone%E2%80%99s-problem#:~:text=According to%20UNESCO%20Science%20the%20percentage%20could%20be%20much%20higher%20). I believe that the **visibility** of historical women scientists is an important point to encourage girls to pursue careers in science, and in particular in engineering and mathematics. To this end, I manage the  instagram account named [Señoras de Ciencia](https://www.instagram.com/senyorasciencia/) (in spanish, sorry) with a lot of love, although I invest less time on it than I would like to. -->
