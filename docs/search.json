    "text": "Hello! I‚Äôm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Alicante (UA), in Spain.\nMy research focuses on computational fluid and solid mechanics, with a particular interest in developing numerical methods to simulate complex and highly dynamic phenomena. My work spans from addressing finite element (FE) problems involving highly elastic viscoelastic flows, fluid‚Äìstructure interaction, to contributing to recent advances in the Material Point Method (MPM). The later is a particle-based technique especially effective for simulating events such as granular flows, landslides, and avalanches, and even used to create the stunning snow effects in Disney‚Äôs Frozen animation.\nAlthough my current research primarily focuses on engineering applications, I am not an engineer by training.\nI began my academic journey studying Mathematics at the University of Alicante. Motivated by a strong interest in applied mathematics, I pursued a Master‚Äôs degree specializing in mathematical modeling for the numerical simulation of physical phenomena. During my PhD at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), my research centered on developing mathematical models to simulate highly elastic viscoelastic flows. After completing my doctorate, I joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Padua (Italy) as a postdoctoral researcher, where I began working with the Material Point Method (MPM) to simulate the behavior of structures under extreme natural events. I later continued this line of research at the Institut f√ºr Statik und Dynamik at the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS) in Germany.\nAs an educator, I aim to inspire curiosity and foster critical thinking among my students. I teach calculus courses tailored to various engineering disciplines, including aerospace, telecommunications, architecture, and robotics. My approach emphasizes connecting theoretical concepts with practical applications, helping students see mathematics as a powerful tool for solving real-world challenges.\n\n\nIn addition to my academic and teaching work, I am an active member of the Kratos Multiphysics community, where I contribute as a developer. Kratos is an open-source simulation software, written in C++ and Python, that focuses on advanced computational mechanics, and I am proud to be involved in its ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartamento de Matem√°tica Aplicada e Ingenier√≠a Aeroespacial (Escuela Polit√©cnica Superior),\nCtra.

    "text": "2.1 The challenges of simulating viscoelastic flows\nViscoelastic fluids are a special type of non-Newtonian fluid, a kind of materials whose behavior changes depending on the forces applied to them. What makes these fluids truly fascinating is that they can act both like regular liquids, flowing and adapting, and like solids that resist and hold their shape‚Ä¶ all depending on how fast or how strongly they are deformed.\nHere you can see a fun experiment carried out at Lamar University (USA), where a small swimming pool was filled with a non-Newtonian fluid. The students were even able to walk on the surface, but only as long as they kept moving!\n\n\nMore specifically, viscoelastic fluids exhibit both viscous (frictional, dissipative) and elastic (energy-storing, memory-retaining) behaviors. This unique combination arises from their complex internal microstructure, which leads to memory effects:\n\nThe current stress state depends not only on the present deformation but also on the entire flow history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, accurately model these fluids is not simple: one must go beyond the classical Navier‚ÄìStokes equations and employ nonlinear constitutive equations. This complexity makes the numerical simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows especially challenging, particularly at high Weissenberg numbers, which correspond to flows dominated by elastic effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Weissenberg effect Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kaye-Effect\n\n\n\n\nThis is in fact one of the biggest challenges in computational rheology, dating back to the 1970s called High Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP). At that time, all methods were observed to break down at relatively low Weissenberg numbers. For approximately 30 years, this breakdown was believed to be a purely numerical phenomenon.\nThis research area started from my PhD work and focuses on the numerical simulation of these complex flows using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The goal is to develop stable and accurate numerical techniques to better understand and predict the behavior of viscoelastic fluids with high elasticity across a wide range of applications, from industrial processes to biological systems.\nThe numerical developments were implemented in the in-house FEM code Femuss. The code allows for modular addition of constitutive models, solver schemes, and stabilization techniques."

    "text": "2.6 Stabilization\nIn incompressible flow problems, using equal-order interpolation for velocity and pressure in finite element methods often leads to numerical instabilities due to the violation of the inf-sup (or Ladyzhenskaya‚ÄìBabu≈°ka‚ÄìBrezzi) condition. This condition is essential to ensure the well-posedness of the continuous and discrete problems, namely the existence and uniqueness of the solution.\nTo address this, stabilization techniques are introduced, modifying the formulation slightly to recover stability without compromising accuracy. Among the various available strategies, we adopt the Variational Multiscale (VMS) method. VMS techniques are robust, residual-based, and provide a systematic framework that enhances stability and ensures mesh-convergent solutions.\nThe key idea in Variational Multiscale Methods (VMS) is to decompose the solution and test space into coarse (resolved) and fine (unresolved) scales: \\[\n\\boldsymbol{U} = \\boldsymbol{U}_h + \\boldsymbol{U}', \\quad \\boldsymbol{V} = \\boldsymbol{V}_h + \\boldsymbol{V}',\n\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{U}_h, \\boldsymbol{V}_h \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}_{h}\\) (finite-dimensional space), and \\(\\boldsymbol{U}', \\boldsymbol{V}' \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}'\\) (the complementary fine-scale space).\nInserting the decomposition into the variational formulation and requiring it to hold for all \\(\\boldsymbol{V}_h \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}_{h}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{V}' \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}'\\), we obtain a coupled system for the resolved and unresolved scales. Then, the fine scales \\(\\boldsymbol{U}'\\) are approximated (typically in terms of the residual of the coarse-scale equation), leading to a modified coarse-scale problem of the form: \\[\n\\mathcal{G}(\\boldsymbol{U}_{h}, \\boldsymbol{V}_{h})+B(\\boldsymbol{u}_h;\\boldsymbol{U}_h, \\boldsymbol{V}_h) + S(\\boldsymbol{U}_h, \\boldsymbol{V}_h) = L(\\boldsymbol{V}_h) \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{V}_h \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}_{h},\n\\] where the stabilization operator \\(S(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\) accounts for the effect of the unresolved scales.\nThis framework provides a systematic and physically motivated way to derive stabilized formulations, especially effective for problems with dominant advection or incompressibility constraints."

    "section": "3.1 Main Concepts",
    "text": "3.1 Main Concepts\nAs mentioned in the overview, one of the main challenges in computational rheology is the simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows at high elasticity. This issue, commonly referred to as the High Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP), severely limits the range of applicability of numerical methods in viscoelastic flow simulations.\nIn 2004, Fattal and Kupferman provided a key insight by identifying two main sources of instability associated with this problem:\n\nInadequate approximations for representing the polymeric stress tensor, which can lead to unphysical results or numerical blow-up.\nThe requirement to preserve the positive-definiteness of the conformation tensor. This tensor, denoted by \\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\lambda \\dfrac{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{\\eta_p} + \\mathbf{I}\n\\] must remain positive-definite to ensure physically meaningful solutions. However, standard discretization techniques may violate this condition, leading to instabilities in the numerical simulation.\n\nThese findings laid the groundwork for the development of more robust numerical schemes, such as the Log-conformation Reformulation (LCR), which aim to overcome these difficulties by reformulating the constitutive equations in a way that inherently preserves the mathematical and physical properties of the model. Therefore, Fattal and Kupferman proposed a reformulation that is essentially a change of variables. The original formulation by Fattal and Kupferman considers the next transformation:\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\n= \\log\\left( \\dfrac{\\lambda \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{\\eta_p} + \\mathbf{I} \\right)\n\\] This change of variables ensure the conformation tensor remains physically admissible, which requires it to be symmetric and positive-definite at all times.\nFollowing this important discovery, we apply the same change of variables, with some modifications to suit our model:\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\psi} = \\log\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\right)\n= \\log\\left( \\dfrac{\\lambda_0 \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{\\eta_p} + \\mathbf{I} \\right)\n\\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\dfrac{\\eta_p}{\\lambda_0} \\left( \\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}) - \\mathbf{I} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\lambda_0 = \\max\\{k\\lambda, \\lambda_{0,\\min}\\}\\).\n\nNote: Unlike the original change of variables, our formulation is non-singular when the Weissenberg number \\(\\mathrm{We}\\) tends to zero, avoiding potential numerical issues in this limit.\n\nBy substituting this reformulated variable \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\) into the original governing equations, we obtain a new system of equations where the primary unknowns are the velocity \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\), the pressure \\(p\\), and the transformed tensor \\(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\).\nConsidering this new system, we develop a Variational Multiscale (VMS) stabilization strategy for stabilize the reformulated problem. Moreover, we design a ‚Äúsplit‚Äù type stabilization method, which focuses on the essential terms necessary to stabilize the problem efficiently, while still achieving optimal convergence rates.\nThis approach significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the numerical simulations for viscoelastic flows at high Weissenberg numbers."

It features a planar channel with a 4:1 contraction, which produces strong elastic effects at high Weissenberg numbers. The goal is to evaluate the stability and accuracy of the numerical approach under demanding flow conditions, and to compare the results with reference data from the literature.\n\n\n\nScheme of the domain\n\n\nThe following images show the streamlines of the fluid flow inside the channel. Before diving into the explanations, I‚Äôd like to apologize to the reader for the terrible color choices. I have no excuse‚Ä¶ but in my defense, I was in the first year of my PhD! That said, it‚Äôs important to clarify that the problem has a stationary solution. Each image corresponds to a different simulation with a different fluid, but all of them share the same Reynolds number, Re = 1.\nRecall that the Weissenberg number (We) indicates the elasticity of the fluid flow. The image labeled We = 0 corresponds to a viscous Newtonian fluid with no elasticity. As the Weissenberg number increases, we can observe how the behavior of the streamlines changes for each elastic fluid. This study allows us to analyze the length and shape of the vortex across different elastic regimes.\nBeyond capturing the expected behavior, one key point should be highlighted: standard formulations (i.e., without any change of variables) typically struggle to simulate beyond We = 2.5. In contrast, our formulation (combined, of course, with the developed stabilization strategy) demonstrates robustness in simulating highly elastic flows, which was the main goal of this work.\n\n\n\nStreamlines for different Weissenberg numbers\n\n\nFinally, the size of the bottom corner vortex is compared with results from the literature for fluids with We ‚â§ 5.
