    "text": "Currently, I am working on large deformation problems in structural mechanics related to hydrological hazard events. This area is particularly interesting for several reasons. On the one hand, civil structures can experience significant deformations and even fractures due to strong impacts, especially during water hazard events such as floods or landslides. On the other hand, most moving masses are modeled as solid materials that undergo these large deformations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Hokkaido landslide after earthquake, Japan (The Guardian)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 A damaged bridge in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, Germany\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Recent Water Hazard Events\n\n\nTo address these challenges, I am using an enriched finite element-based technique known as the Material Point Method (MPM).\nLet me show you a very simple two-dimensional example of a MPM problem, where we can observe the two different discretizations used in this method: the Background Mesh (similar to the Finite Element Mesh) and the particle discretization (material points, in red). A granular flow is considered here, moving downward due to gravitational forces.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 2D Problem of a granular flow going downhill\n\n\nAn good overview about this method is: Material Point Method after 25 years theory, implementation and applications [Link].\nMy research focuses on developing and implementing stabilization techniques that addresses the inherent instabilities of incompressible materials (water would be an incompressible material, for example). The objective is to accurately simulate both solid and fluid incompressible problems using the MPM, clearly involved in an hidrological hazard event."

    "text": "Computational fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical simulations of viscoelastic fluid flow with high elasticity\nThe overarching goal of my thesis was to develop mathematical models and numerical methods to simulate viscoelastic flows with high elasticity using the Finite Element Method. The equations modeling viscoelastic fluid flow present numerous nonlinearities. Additionally, when the elasticity of the fluid dominates over the convective forces, new instabilities must be addressed. Accurately reproducing these conditions is considered one of the biggest challenges in computational rheology, as classical methods fail to capture high levels of elasticity.\n\n\nOther projects in fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical analysis of the optical quality over a telescope\nIn this project, we studied the influence of one telescope on another concerning optical parameters. To conduct the study, we solved the Navier-Stokes equations on real terrain, accounting for temperature and using the Smagorinsky model to capture turbulence. We then calculated the optical parameters influenced by the air temperature.\n\n\nNumerical analysis of the aerodynamic loads on a tunnel wall separation\nWe evaluated the aerodynamic loads at the ends of constructed sections caused by transient flows due to train motion along the Mont-Royal tunnel. We conducted a CFD simulation using moving domains, where the tunnel geometry remained fixed while the train moved inside it. We employed an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian strategy, solving the Navier-Stokes equations to account for this motion."

This method is commonly used in automotive factories to detect fractures in crankshafts using fluorescent metal shavings."

The equations modeling viscoelastic fluid flow present numerous nonlinearities. Additionally, when the elasticity of the fluid dominates over the convective forces, new instabilities must be addressed. Accurately reproducing these conditions is considered one of the biggest challenges in computational rheology, as classical methods fail to capture high levels of elasticity.\n\n\nOther projects in fluid dynamics\n\nNumerical analysis of the optical quality over a telescope\nIn this project, we studied the influence of one telescope on another concerning optical parameters.

We then calculated the optical parameters influenced by the air temperature.\n\n\nNumerical analysis of the aerodynamic loads on a tunnel wall separation\nWe evaluated the aerodynamic loads at the ends of constructed sections caused by transient flows due to train motion along the Mont-Royal tunnel.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Viscoelastic fluids are a class of non-Newtonian materials that exhibit both viscous (frictional, dissipative) and elastic (energy-storing, memory-retaining) behaviors. This unique combination stems from their complex internal microstructure, which leads to memory effects:\n\nThe current stress state depends not only on the present deformation but also on the entire flow history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo accurately model these fluids, one must go beyond the classical Navier–Stokes equations and employ nonlinear constitutive equations. This complexity makes the numerical simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows especially challenging, particularly at high Weissenberg numbers, which correspond to flows dominated by elastic effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Weissenberg effect Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kaye-Effect\n\n\n\n\nThis is in fact one of the biggest challenges in computational rheology, dating back to the 1970s. At that time, all methods were observed to break down at relatively low Weissenberg numbers. For approximately 30 years, this breakdown was believed to be a purely numerical phenomenon.\nNowadays, the so-called High Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP) continues to motivate the development of new formulations and numerical strategies for robust and accurate simulations.\nThis research line originated from my PhD work and focuses on the numerical simulation of these complex flows using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The goal is to develop stable and accurate numerical techniques to better understand and predict the behavior of viscoelastic fluids with high elasticity across a wide range of applications, from industrial processes to biological systems.\nThis research line naturally builds upon Ernesto Castillo’s PhD thesis, and most of the developments presented here are part of my own PhD dissertation.\n\n\nWhile Newtonian fluids can be modeled using only the Navier–Stokes equations (which include the momentum and continuity equations), modeling viscoelastic fluid flows requires a nonlinear constitutive equation to properly capture the elastic behavior of the fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMomentum equation\n\\[\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t} + \\rho \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T} + \\nabla p = \\boldsymbol{f}\n\\]\nContinuity equation\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0\n\\]\nConstitutive equation\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2 \\eta_p} \\big(1 + \\mathfrak{h}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\big) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{u} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2 \\eta_p} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} + (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{T} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\right) = \\mathbf{0}\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere the unknowns are the velocity \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\), pressure \\(p\\) and the extra stress tensor \\(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\). The Deviatoric stress tensor is denoted by \\(\\mathbf{T}\\), \\(\\eta_p\\) is the polymer viscosity coefficient and \\(\\lambda\\) is the relaxation time. The expression of \\(\\mathfrak{h}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\) depends on the model chosen. In general \\(\\mathfrak{h}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})=0\\), which corresponds to the Oldroyd-B model.\nAlso, note that \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) adopts different forms, depending of the fluid flow to simulate:\n\nNewtonian viscous fluids: \\(\\mathbf{T} = 2 \\eta \\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{u}\\)\nPolymeric fluids: \\(\\mathbf{T} = 2 \\eta_s \\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\eta_s\\) is the solvent viscosity for viscoelastic fluid flows. Note that \\(\\eta_s+\\eta_p=\\eta\\), that is the usual viscosity employed for Newtonian fluids.\n\n\n\nThe Weissenberg number (We) is a dimensionless quantity that compares elastic and viscous effects in viscoelastic fluid flows. It is defined as:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{We} = \\frac{\\lambda U}{L}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\lambda\\) is relaxation time, \\(U\\) is the characteristic velocity and \\(L\\) characteristic length.\nThe physical interpretation is:\n\nIf \\(\\mathrm{We}\\) is small: Viscous effects dominate, elastic behavior is negligible.\n\nIf \\(\\mathrm{We}\\) is large (typically \\(\\mathrm{We} &gt; 1\\)): Elastic effects become significant, leading to complex flow behavior and numerical difficulties.\n\n\n\n\nThe weak form of the problem consists in finding \\(\\boldsymbol{U} = [\\boldsymbol{u}, p, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}] : ]0, t_{\\rm f}[ \\longrightarrow \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}} := \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}_0 \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{Q}} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\Upsilon}\\), such that the initial conditions are satisfied and:\n\\[\n\\left(\\rho \\dfrac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t}, \\boldsymbol{v}\\right)\n+ (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{v})\n+ 2 (eta_{s} \\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{u}, \\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{v})\n+ \\langle \\rho \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle\n- (p, \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v})\n= \\langle \\boldsymbol{f}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle,\n\\] \\[\n(q, \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}) = 0,\n\\] \\[\n\\dfrac{1}{2 \\eta_{p}} (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\chi})\n- (\\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{u}, \\boldsymbol{\\chi})\n+ \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2 \\eta_{p}} \\left(\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{\\partial t}\n+ \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\n- \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}\n- (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{T} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma},\n\\boldsymbol{\\chi} \\right) = 0,\n\\]\nfor all \\(\\boldsymbol{V} = [\\boldsymbol{v}, q, \\boldsymbol{\\chi}] \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}\\), where it is assumed that \\(\\boldsymbol{f}\\) is such that \\(\\langle \\boldsymbol{f}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle\\) is well defined.\nIn compact form, the problem can be written as:\n\\[ \\mathcal{G}(\\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{V})\n+ B(\\boldsymbol{u}; \\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{V})\n= L(\\boldsymbol{V}),\\]\nfor all \\(\\boldsymbol{V} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}\\), where:\n\\(\\mathcal{G}(\\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{V}) = \\left(\\rho \\dfrac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t}, \\boldsymbol{v}\\right) + \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2 \\eta_{0}} \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{\\partial t}, \\boldsymbol{\\chi} \\right),\\)\n\\(\\begin{aligned} B(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}; \\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{V}) =\\ & 2 (\\eta_{s} \\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{u}, \\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{v}) + \\langle \\rho \\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle + (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{v}) \\\\ & - (p, \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}) + (q, \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}) + \\dfrac{1}{2 \\eta_{p}} (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\chi}) - (\\nabla^{s} \\boldsymbol{u}, \\boldsymbol{\\chi}) \\\\ & + \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2 \\eta_{p}} \\left( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\nabla \\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}} - (\\nabla \\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}})^{T} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\chi} \\right), \\end{aligned}\\)\n\\(L(\\boldsymbol{V}) = \\langle \\boldsymbol{f}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle.\\)\n\n\n\nThe Galerkin finite element method consists in seeking an approximate solution within a finite-dimensional subspace of the original infinite-dimensional function space. Given a weak formulation of the problem, the solution is approximated by projecting it onto a finite element space constructed from piecewise polynomial basis functions defined over a mesh of the computational domain.\n\nIn this framework, the trial and test functions are chosen from the same finite element space, ensuring consistency and stability under appropriate conditions. \nIn general, the finite element partition of the domain \\(\\Omega\\) is denoted by \\(\\mathcal{T}_{h} = \\{K\\}\\). Likewise, the diameter of an element \\(K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}\\) is denoted by \\(h_{K}\\), and the diameter of the partition is defined as \\(h = \\max\\{h_{K} \\mid K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}\\}.\\) From \\(\\mathcal{T}_{h}\\) we construct conforming finite element spaces for the velocity, the pressure, and the elastic stress: \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}_{h} \\subset \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}\\), \\(\\mathcal{Q}_{h} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Upsilon}_{h} \\subset \\boldsymbol{\\Upsilon}\\), respectively.\nTherefore, defining \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}_{h} := \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}_{h} \\times \\mathcal{Q}_{h} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\Upsilon}_{h},\\) the Galerkin finite element approximation of the standard problem consists in finding \\(\\boldsymbol{U}_{h} : ]0, t_{\\mathrm{f}}[ \\longrightarrow \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}_{h},\\) such that:\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\mathcal{G}(\\boldsymbol{U}_{h}, \\boldsymbol{V}_{h})}_{\\text{Temporal terms}} +\n\\underbrace{B(\\boldsymbol{u}_{h}; \\boldsymbol{U}_{h}, \\boldsymbol{V}_{h})}_{\\text{Bilinear form}}\n= L(\\boldsymbol{V}_{h}),\n\\]\nfor all \\(\\boldsymbol{V}_{h} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}_{h}\\).\nThe resulting system is a set of algebraic equations that can be efficiently solved using numerical linear algebra techniques.\n\n\n\nPor qué hay que estabilizar (fluido incompresible).
