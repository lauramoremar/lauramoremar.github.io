# Overview

## The challenges of simulating viscoelastic flows
Viscoelastic fluids are a class of non-Newtonian materials that exhibit both **viscous** (frictional, dissipative) and **elastic** (energy-storing, memory-retaining) behaviors. This unique combination stems from their **complex internal microstructure**, which leads to *memory effects*:

> The current stress state depends not only on the present deformation but also on the entire **flow history**.

To accurately model these fluids, one *must go beyond the classical Navierâ€“Stokes equations* and employ nonlinear constitutive equations. This complexity makes the numerical simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows **especially challenging**, particularly at high Weissenberg numbers, which correspond to flows dominated by elastic effects.

This is in fact  **one of the biggest challenges** in computational rheology, dating back to the **1970s** called **High Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP)**. At that time, all methods were observed to **break down** at relatively low Weissenberg numbers. For approximately 30 years, this breakdown was believed to be a purely *numerical phenomenon*. 


This research area started from my [PhD work ](assets/docs/PhDThesisLauraMoreno.pdf) and focuses on the numerical simulation of these complex flows using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The goal is to develop **stable and accurate numerical techniques** to better understand and predict the **behavior of viscoelastic fluids with high elasticity** across a wide range of applications, from industrial processes to biological systems.



The numerical developments were implemented in the in-house FEM code **Femuss**. The code allows for modular addition of constitutive models, solver schemes, and stabilization techniques.

## Modelling of polymeric fluid flows


While Newtonian fluids can be modeled using only the Navierâ€“Stokes equations (which include the momentum and continuity equations), modeling viscoelastic fluid flows requires a **nonlinear constitutive equation** to properly capture the elastic behavior of the fluid.

::: {.callout}
Momentum equation

$$
\rho \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \rho \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{u} - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{T} + \nabla p = \boldsymbol{f}
$$

Continuity equation

$$
\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0
$$

Constitutive equation

$$
\frac{1}{2 \eta_p} \big(1 + \mathfrak{h}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \big) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \nabla^s \boldsymbol{u} + \frac{\lambda}{2 \eta_p} \left( \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla \boldsymbol{u})^{T} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right) = \mathbf{0}
$$
:::

where the unknowns are the velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$, pressure $p$ and the extra stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$. The Deviatoric stress tensor is denoted by $\mathbf{T}$, $\eta_p$ is the polymer viscosity coefficient and
$\lambda$ is the relaxation time. The expression of $\mathfrak{h}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ depends on the model chosen. In general $\mathfrak{h}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})=0$, which corresponds to the Oldroyd-B model.

Also, note that $\mathbf{T}$ adopts different forms, depending of the fluid flow to simulate:

  - Newtonian viscous fluids: $\mathbf{T} = 2 \eta \nabla^s \boldsymbol{u}$

  - Polymeric fluids: $\mathbf{T} = 2 \eta_s \nabla^s \boldsymbol{u} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}$

where $\eta_s$ is the solvent viscosity for viscoelastic fluid flows. Note that $\eta_s+\eta_p=\eta$, that is the usual viscosity employed for Newtonian fluids.

## The Weissenberg Number

The Weissenberg number (**We**) is a dimensionless quantity that compares **elastic** and **viscous** effects in viscoelastic fluid flows. It is defined as:

$$
\mathrm{We} = \frac{\lambda U}{L}
$$

Where $\lambda$ is relaxation time, $U$ is the characteristic velocity and $L$ characteristic length.

The physical interpretation is:

- If **$\mathrm{We}$ is small**: Viscous effects dominate, elastic behavior is negligible.  
- If **$\mathrm{We}$ is large** (typically $\mathrm{We} > 1$): Elastic effects become significant, leading to **complex flow behavior** and **numerical difficulties**.


## Weak Formulation

The weak form of the problem consists in finding $\boldsymbol{U} = [\boldsymbol{u}, p, \boldsymbol{\sigma}] : ]0, t_{\rm f}[ \longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}} := \boldsymbol{\mathcal{V}}_0 \times \boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}} \times \boldsymbol{\Upsilon}$,   such that the initial conditions are satisfied and:

$$
\left(\rho \dfrac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}, \boldsymbol{v}\right) 
+ (\boldsymbol{\sigma}, \nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{v}) 
+ 2 (\eta_{s} \nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{u}, \nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{v}) 
+ \langle \rho \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle 
- (p, \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v}) 
= \langle \boldsymbol{f}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle,
$$
$$
(q, \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}) = 0,
$$
$$
\dfrac{1}{2 \eta_{p}} (\boldsymbol{\sigma}, \boldsymbol{\chi}) 
- (\nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{\chi}) 
+ \dfrac{\lambda}{2 \eta_{p}} \left( 
\dfrac{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{\partial t} 
+ \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{\sigma} 
- \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{u} 
- (\nabla \boldsymbol{u})^{T} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}, 
\boldsymbol{\chi} \right) = 0,
$$

for all  $\boldsymbol{V} = [\boldsymbol{v}, q, \boldsymbol{\chi}] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}$,  where it is assumed that $\boldsymbol{f}$ is such that   $\langle \boldsymbol{f}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle$ is well defined.

In compact form, the problem can be written as:

$$ \mathcal{G}(\boldsymbol{U}, \boldsymbol{V}) 
+ B(\boldsymbol{u}; \boldsymbol{U}, \boldsymbol{V}) 
= L(\boldsymbol{V}),$$

for all $\boldsymbol{V} \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}$, where:

$\mathcal{G}(\boldsymbol{U}, \boldsymbol{V}) =  \left(\rho \dfrac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}, \boldsymbol{v}\right) + \dfrac{\lambda}{2 \eta_{0}} \left(\dfrac{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{\partial t}, \boldsymbol{\chi} \right),$

$\begin{aligned} B(\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}; \boldsymbol{U}, \boldsymbol{V}) =\ & 2 (\eta_{s} \nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{u}, \nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{v}) + \langle \rho \hat{\boldsymbol{u}} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle + (\boldsymbol{\sigma}, \nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{v}) \\ & - (p, \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v}) + (q, \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}) + \dfrac{1}{2 \eta_{p}} (\boldsymbol{\sigma}, \boldsymbol{\chi}) - (\nabla^{s} \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{\chi}) \\ & + \dfrac{\lambda}{2 \eta_{p}} \left( \hat{\boldsymbol{u}} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \nabla \hat{\boldsymbol{u}} - (\nabla \hat{\boldsymbol{u}})^{T} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}, \boldsymbol{\chi} \right), \end{aligned}$

$L(\boldsymbol{V}) = \langle \boldsymbol{f}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle.$


## Spatial discretization using the Finite Element Method

The **Galerkin finite element method** consists in seeking an approximate solution within a finite-dimensional subspace of the original infinite-dimensional function space. 
Given a weak formulation of the problem, the solution is approximated by projecting it onto a finite element space constructed from piecewise polynomial basis functions defined over a mesh of the computational domain.\

In this framework, the trial and test functions are chosen from the same finite element space, ensuring consistency and stability under appropriate conditions.\ 

In general, the finite element partition of the domain $\Omega$ is denoted by $\mathcal{T}_{h} = \{K\}$. Likewise, the diameter of an element $K \in \mathcal{T}_{h}$ is denoted by $h_{K}$, and the diameter of the partition is defined as $h = \max\{h_{K} \mid K \in \mathcal{T}_{h}\}.$
From $\mathcal{T}_{h}$ we construct conforming finite element spaces for the velocity, the pressure, and the elastic stress: 
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{V}}_{h} \subset \boldsymbol{\mathcal{V}}$, 
$\mathcal{Q}_{h} \subset \mathcal{Q}$, and 
$\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}_{h} \subset \boldsymbol{\Upsilon}$, respectively. 

Therefore, defining $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{h} := \boldsymbol{\mathcal{V}}_{h} \times \mathcal{Q}_{h} \times \boldsymbol{\Upsilon}_{h},$
the Galerkin finite element approximation of the standard problem consists in finding  $\boldsymbol{U}_{h} : ]0, t_{\mathrm{f}}[ \longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{h},$
such that:

$$
\underbrace{\mathcal{G}(\boldsymbol{U}_{h}, \boldsymbol{V}_{h})}_{\text{Temporal terms}} + 
\underbrace{B(\boldsymbol{u}_{h}; \boldsymbol{U}_{h}, \boldsymbol{V}_{h})}_{\text{Bilinear form}} 
= L(\boldsymbol{V}_{h}),
$$

for all $\boldsymbol{V}_{h} \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{h}$.

The resulting system is a set of algebraic equations that can be efficiently solved using numerical linear algebra techniques.

## Stabilization

In incompressible flow problems, using equal-order interpolation for velocity and pressure in finite element methods **often leads to numerical instabilities due to the violation of the inf-sup** (or Ladyzhenskayaâ€“BabuÅ¡kaâ€“Brezzi) **condition**. This condition is essential to ensure the well-posedness of the continuous and discrete problems, namely the existence and uniqueness of the solution. 

To address this, stabilization techniques are introduced, modifying the formulation slightly to recover stability without compromising accuracy. Among the various available strategies, we adopt the **Variational Multiscale (VMS) method**. VMS techniques are robust, residual-based, and provide a systematic framework that enhances stability and ensures mesh-convergent solutions.

The key idea in Variational Multiscale Methods (VMS) is to decompose the solution and test space into *coarse (resolved)* and *fine (unresolved)* scales:
$$
\boldsymbol{U} = \boldsymbol{U}_h + \boldsymbol{U}', \quad \boldsymbol{V} = \boldsymbol{V}_h + \boldsymbol{V}',
$$
where $\boldsymbol{U}_h, \boldsymbol{V}_h \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{h}$ (finite-dimensional space), and $\boldsymbol{U}', \boldsymbol{V}' \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}'$ (the complementary fine-scale space).

Inserting the decomposition into the variational formulation and requiring it to hold for all $\boldsymbol{V}_h \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{h}$ and $\boldsymbol{V}' \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}'$, we obtain a coupled system for the resolved and unresolved scales. Then, the fine scales $\boldsymbol{U}'$ are approximated (typically in terms of the residual of the coarse-scale equation), leading to a modified coarse-scale problem of the form:
$$
\mathcal{G}(\boldsymbol{U}_{h}, \boldsymbol{V}_{h})+B(\boldsymbol{u}_h;\boldsymbol{U}_h, \boldsymbol{V}_h) + S(\boldsymbol{U}_h, \boldsymbol{V}_h) = L(\boldsymbol{V}_h) \quad \forall \boldsymbol{V}_h \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{h},
$$
where the stabilization operator $S(\cdot, \cdot)$ accounts for the effect of the unresolved scales.

This framework provides a systematic and physically motivated way to derive stabilized formulations, especially effective for problems with dominant advection or incompressibility constraints.

## Main Concepts
As mentioned in the overview, one of the main challenges in computational rheology is the simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows **at high elasticity**. This issue, commonly referred to as the High Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP), severely limits the range of applicability of numerical methods in viscoelastic flow simulations.

In 2004, Fattal and Kupferman provided a key insight by identifying two main sources of instability associated with this problem:

1. Inadequate approximations for representing the polymeric stress tensor, which can lead to unphysical results or numerical blow-up.

2. The requirement to preserve the positive-definiteness of the conformation tensor. This tensor, denoted by
$$
\boldsymbol{\tau} = \lambda \dfrac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}{\eta_p} + \mathbf{I}
$$
must remain positive-definite to ensure physically meaningful solutions. However, standard discretization techniques may violate this condition, leading to instabilities in the numerical simulation.

These findings laid the groundwork for the development of more robust numerical schemes, such as the **Log-conformation Reformulation (LCR)**, which aim to overcome these difficulties by reformulating the constitutive equations in a way that inherently preserves the mathematical and physical properties of the model. Therefore, Fattal and Kupferman proposed a reformulation that is essentially **a change of variables**.
The original formulation by Fattal and Kupferman considers the next transformation:

$$
\boldsymbol{\psi} 
= \log\left( \dfrac{\lambda \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{\eta_p} + \mathbf{I} \right)
$$
This change of variables ensure the conformation tensor remains physically admissible, which requires it to be **symmetric** and **positive-definite** at all times. 

Following this important discovery, we apply the same change of variables, with some modifications to suit our model:

$$
\boldsymbol{\psi} = \log\left(\boldsymbol{\tau}\right)
= \log\left( \dfrac{\lambda_0 \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{\eta_p} + \mathbf{I} \right)
\quad \longrightarrow \quad
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \dfrac{\eta_p}{\lambda_0} \left( \exp(\boldsymbol{\psi}) - \mathbf{I} \right)
$$

where, $\lambda_0 = \max\{k\lambda, \lambda_{0,\min}\}$.

> **Note:** Unlike the original change of variables, **our formulation is non-singular** when the Weissenberg number $\mathrm{We}$ tends to zero, avoiding potential numerical issues in this limit.

By substituting this reformulated variable $\boldsymbol{\psi}$ into the original governing equations, we obtain **a new system of equations** where the primary unknowns are the velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$, the pressure $p$, and the transformed tensor $\boldsymbol{\psi}$.

Considering this new system, we develop a Variational Multiscale (VMS) stabilization strategy **for stabilize the reformulated problem**. Moreover, we design a "split" type stabilization method, which focuses on the essential terms necessary to stabilize the problem efficiently, while still achieving optimal convergence rates.

This approach significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the numerical simulations for viscoelastic flows at high Weissenberg numbers.
