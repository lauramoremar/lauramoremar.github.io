## Numerical analysis of the optical quality over a telescope
In this project, we studied the influence of one telescope on another concerning optical parameters. To conduct the study, we solved the Navier-Stokes equations on real terrain, accounting for temperature and using the Smagorinsky model to capture turbulence. We then calculated the optical parameters influenced by the air temperature.

## Numerical analysis of the aerodynamic loads on a tunnel wall separation
We evaluated the aerodynamic loads at the ends of constructed sections caused by transient flows due to train motion along the Mont-Royal tunnel. We conducted a CFD simulation using moving domains, where the tunnel geometry remained fixed while the train moved inside it. We employed an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian strategy, solving the Navier-Stokes equations to account for this motion.
